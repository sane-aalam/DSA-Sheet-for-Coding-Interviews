# LeetCode Focused DSA Interview Prep - 4 Month Plan

This README outlines a structured plan for preparing for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interviews using primarily LeetCode over a 4-month period.  This plan emphasizes a focused approach using LeetCode's resources and problem sets.

## Month 1: LeetCode Fundamentals & Language Proficiency

* **Goal:** Become comfortable with LeetCode's interface, basic data structures, and your chosen language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
* **Activities:**
    * **LeetCode Explore Cards (Beginner):** Work through LeetCode's Explore Cards for beginner-level topics. These provide structured learning on fundamental concepts.
    * **Language Practice (LeetCode):** Solve easy-level LeetCode problems to solidify your language proficiency. Focus on clean, readable code.
    * **Basic Data Structures (LeetCode):** Start with LeetCode's array/string and linked list problems (easy).  Implement these from scratch if possible in a separate environment to reinforce your understanding.
    * **Big O Notation:**  Understand Big O notation and analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions on LeetCode.  LeetCode's discussion forums often provide insights.

## Month 2: Core Data Structures & Algorithms (LeetCode)

* **Goal:** Learn and implement core data structures and algorithms using LeetCode problems as your primary learning tool.
* **Activities:**
    * **LeetCode Explore Cards (Intermediate):** Move on to the intermediate-level Explore Cards, covering trees, graphs, and other core concepts.
    * **Trees (LeetCode):** Focus on binary tree problems (easy/medium). Practice tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder) and basic operations.
    * **Graphs (LeetCode):** Solve easy/medium graph problems, focusing on BFS and DFS.
    * **Sorting & Searching (LeetCode):** Practice problems related to sorting (merge sort, quick sort) and searching (binary search). LeetCode's tag filtering is your friend.
    * **Start Contests (LeetCode):** Participate in LeetCode Weekly Contests to get used to solving problems under pressure.

## Month 3: Advanced Algorithms & Problem Solving (LeetCode)

* **Goal:** Deepen your understanding of advanced algorithms and improve your problem-solving skills by tackling harder LeetCode problems.
* **Activities:**
    * **Dynamic Programming (LeetCode):**  Focus on DP problems (easy/medium initially, then move to medium/hard).  LeetCode's tagged problems are excellent for this.
    * **Greedy Algorithms (LeetCode):** Practice greedy algorithm problems.
    * **Backtracking (LeetCode):** Tackle backtracking problems.
    * **Graph Algorithms (Advanced - LeetCode):** Explore more advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra's, topological sort, etc., through LeetCode's problem set.
    * **LeetCode Difficulty Progression:**  Gradually increase the difficulty of the problems you're solving.  Don't be afraid to look at solutions and learn from them, but try to implement them yourself afterward.
    * **Virtual Contests (LeetCode):**  Practice past LeetCode contests virtually to simulate the real experience.

## Month 4: Review, Practice, and Refine (LeetCode)

* **Goal:** Review all concepts, focus on weak areas identified through LeetCode performance, and refine your problem-solving and communication skills.
* **Activities:**
    * **Review All Topics (LeetCode):** Revisit previously solved problems and review the underlying concepts. LeetCode's "My Submissions" section is useful.
    * **Identify Weak Areas (LeetCode):** Analyze your performance in contests and practice sessions to pinpoint areas where you need improvement.  LeetCode's rating system can help.
    * **LeetCode Problem Grinding:** Focus on medium/hard problems in your weak areas.
    * **Mock Interviews (LeetCode Discuss/Premium):** Use LeetCode's discuss forum to find mock interview questions or consider LeetCode Premium for more structured mock interviews.
    * **System Design (LeetCode Premium/External Resources):**  If needed, use LeetCode Premium or other resources to prepare for system design questions.
    * **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare for behavioral questions separately.

## Resources (Primarily LeetCode)

* **LeetCode:**  The primary resource for this plan.
* **LeetCode Discuss Forum:**  Invaluable for understanding different approaches and learning from other users.
* **LeetCode Explore Cards:** Structured learning paths.
* **LeetCode Contests:**  Practice and assessment.
* **LeetCode Premium (Optional):**  Additional features like mock interviews and company-specific questions.

## Tips for Success (LeetCode Focused)

* **Consistent Practice (LeetCode):** Regular problem solving on LeetCode is crucial.
* **Understand Solutions (LeetCode):** Don't just copy solutions. Understand the logic behind them and try to implement them yourself.  LeetCode's discuss forum is essential here.
* **Utilize LeetCode Tags:** Use LeetCode's tag system to focus on specific topics.
* **Participate in Contests (LeetCode):**  Regular participation in contests helps you improve your speed and problem-solving skills.
* **Analyze Your Performance (LeetCode):**  Use LeetCode's statistics and rating system to track your progress and identify areas for improvement.
* **Focus on Quality over Quantity (LeetCode):**  Deeply understanding a few problems is better than superficially solving many.

This plan is tailored for a LeetCode-centric approach.  Remember to adjust it to your specific needs and progress. Good luck!
